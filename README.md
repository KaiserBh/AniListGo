# AniList Go Wrapper

This is just a package to use in your application if you wish. As of now it's not completed and still missing a lot of functionality such as user authentication or getting user list but I plan on adding them in the following weeks or days, so far I have implemented media query and basic of Pagination such as getting Anime ID, Title and much more that are stored in a struct which then can be used to get data for your websites.

P.S there might be some bad coding practise in Go do let me know (still learning)
